In the age of AI, an assistant's power isn't just in its model, but in the **Context** it can access. **Semoia MCP (Model Context Protocol)** eliminates AI "amnesia" by providing a structured, long-term, and shareable memory system.

Semoia acts as a sustainable bridge between your ideas and the execution capabilities of leading AI agents like Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT, and Windsurf.

## The Three Pillars of Power

Semoia's ecosystem is built on three core pillars designed to transform your AI into a true long-term collaborator:

- **Notebooks**: Your structured, long-term knowledge base.
- **Jots**: Rapid-fire idea capture with intelligent tagging.
- **Context Sharing**: Seamless continuity between different AI agents.
