description: "Give your AI a long-term memory"

Semoia helps your AI remember things. It builds a simple "external brain" for your AI assistants like Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude.

With Semoia, your AI won't forget what you talked about before. It uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to connect your ideas directly to your favorite tools.

## Three Simple Features

Semoia gives your AI three new powers:

- **Notebooks**: For long notes and project details.
- **Jots**: For quick ideas and fast notes.
- **Context Sharing**: To move a conversation from one AI to another.
