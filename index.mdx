## What is Semoia?
Semoia is an **Intellectual Ledger**. It transforms your temporary AI conversations into permanent, structured, and **reusable knowledge assets**.

Instead of letting valuable insights vanish when you close a tab, Semoia captures and organizes them to solve three major AI workflow bottlenecks:

* **Context Memory:** It overcomes the AI's "goldfish memory" by preserving long-term context, so you never have to repeat yourself.
* **Data Isolation:** It breaks down the walls between chats, allowing you to transfer knowledge from one project to another.
* **Information Clutter:** It filters out the noise, turning messy chat logs into clean, usable documentation.

**Simply put:** Semoia helps your AI remember longer, connect ideas, and reuse knowledge across projects.
