## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while setting up or using Semoia MCP, check the following common solutions:

### 403 Forbidden
This usually happens when the mandatory `Origin` header is missing or incorrect.
- **Solution**: Ensure your configuration includes the header `"Origin": "https://beta.trysemoia.com"`.

### 401 Unauthorized
This indicates an issue with your API Key.
- **Solution**: Verify that you are using a valid API Key from your [Dashboard](https://beta.trysemoia.com/api-keys) and that it correctly replaces `YOUR_API_KEY` in the configuration.

### Connection Failures
The AI client cannot establish a connection to the MCP server.
- **Solution**: 
  - Ensure the URL is exactly `https://beta.trysemoia.com/api/mcp`.
  - Check for any trailing spaces or typos in the URL.
  - Ensure your internet connection is stable and can reach the domain.
