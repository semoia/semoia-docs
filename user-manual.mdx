Semoia helps you build an "external brain" for your AI. It uses two main ways to save information: **Notebooks** and **Jots**.

## 1. Notebooks (Long Memory)
Use Notebooks for large projects and detailed information.
- **Good for**: Coding projects, big ideas, and long notes.
- **How it works**: The AI organizes your notes with headings. It remembers old versions so you never lose work.

## 2. Jots (Quick Memory)
Use Jots for fast thoughts and short notes.
- **Good for**: "To-do" lists, quick reminders, and small ideas.
- **How it works**: You just tell the AI to save a "jot". Use hashtags like `#todo` to stay organized.

## Simple Workflow

1. **Capture**: Tell your AI to save a Jot or write to a Notebook.
2. **Search**: Ask your AI to find something from your past notes.
3. **Share**: Move your conversation memory between different AI apps (like from Cursor to Claude).

Semoia is here to make sure your AI always has the context it needs to help you best.
