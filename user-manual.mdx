## Core Concepts

Semoia is built around two main concepts: **Ledgers** and **Memories**.

### Ledgers
A **Ledger** is a project-specific knowledge base. Think of it as a container for all the information related to a specific goal, app, or research topic.

### Memories
**Memories** are the individual building blocks of knowledge. They are captured from your conversations with AI models. You can link one memory to multiple ledgers, allowing you to reuse information across projects.

## How it Works

1. **Capture**: Use the Browser Extension or MCP to capture high-value insights from your AI chats.
2. **Organize**: Link new memories to relevant Ledgers.
3. **Retrieve**: Ask your AI agents about your context. They will query your Ledgers to provide grounded, accurate answers.
