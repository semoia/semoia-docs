## Features & Usage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="folder-open" title="What is a Ledger?">
    A **Ledger** is equivalent to a "Project" in Semoia. It's the place that holds the history of your knowledge for a specific topic or project. Ledgers can be cloned and reused across different projects, making it easy to build on previous work.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="database" title="What are Memories?">
    **Memories** are raw data captured from your AI conversations (chat logs and notes). They can be injected into multiple different Ledgers, allowing you to reuse the same conversation across different projects without having to repeat yourself.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="bookmark" title="What is a Checkpoint?">
    A **Checkpoint** is the complete version of your knowledge at a specific point in time. The latest Checkpoint is always the most correct and complete source of truth. When you update a Ledger, Semoia creates a new Checkpoint by synthesizing new Memories with the previous Checkpoint.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="wand-magic-sparkles" title="What are Rules?">
    **Rules** are instructions for the AI that dictate how it extracts information from Memories to put into the Checkpoint. You can set rules like "Summarize key points" or "Keep the code" to control how your knowledge is organized.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="repeat" title="How does knowledge reusability work?">
    Semoia's reusability feature allows you to:
    
    - **Reuse Memories:** Feed the same Memory (conversation) into multiple Ledgers
    - **Reuse Ledgers:** Clone a finished Ledger to kickstart a new project
    
    This means you never have to have the same conversation twice or rebuild knowledge from scratch.
  </Accordion>
