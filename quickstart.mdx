This guide shows you how to connect **Semoia** to your AI tools using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

1.  **Semoia Account**: Join the beta at the [Semoia Dashboard](https://beta.trysemoia.com).
2.  **API Key**: Copy your key from the [Settings](https://beta.trysemoia.com/api-keys) page.
3.  **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js (18+) installed for the CLI setup.

## Quick Setup (Recommended)

The easiest way to configure your AI tools is using our CLI tool. It automatically detects and configures supported clients like Cursor, VS Code, and Claude.

Run this command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx @semoia/install-mcp
```

```bash pnpm
pnpx @semoia/install-mcp
```

```bash bun
bunx @semoia/install-mcp
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx @semoia/install-mcp
```

</CodeGroup>

## Alternative: Shell Script

If you prefer using a shell script or need to target a specific client manually:

```bash Terminal
curl -fsSL https://beta.trysemoia.com/scripts/install-mcp.sh | bash
```

To target a specific supported client:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://beta.trysemoia.com/scripts/install-mcp.sh | bash -s -- cursor
```

Supported targets: `cursor`, `vscode`, `windsurf`, `claude-code`, `claude-desktop`, `antigravity`, `trae`, `zed`, `boltai`, `gemini`.
