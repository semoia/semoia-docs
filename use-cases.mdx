Semoia makes your AI smarter by giving it a memory. Here are some easy ways to use it.

## Simple Workflows

### 1. Building New Things
1. **Jots**: Save small ideas as you think of them using `jot`.
2. **Notebooks**: Ask the AI to put those ideas into a **Notebook**.
3. **Execution**: While you work, the AI saves updates to the Notebook so it never forgets your project's rules.

### 2. Multi-AI Help
Found a hard problem?
- **Save**: Tell your first AI to "Save context".
- **Switch**: Open a different, smarter AI tool.
- **Load**: Tell it to "Load context". 
- **Solve**: It now knows the whole story and can help you fix the problem faster.

### 3. Personal Knowledge
Create a "Personal" notebook for things you use all the time:
- Your favorite code patterns.
- How you like to organize folders.
- Links and details you always forget.

Just ask: *"Check my 'Personal' notebook for how to do X."*
