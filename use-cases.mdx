Semoia MCP transforms your AI from a stateless chatbot into a project-aware collaborator. Here are the specialized workflows used by elite developer teams.

## Specialized Workflows

### 1. Feature Development Lifecycle
Don't let your feature ideas die in the chat history. Use this end-to-end flow:
1. **Brainstorming**: Use **Jots** to record fragmented ideas as you think of them.
2. **Structuring**: Ask the AI to synthesize those jots into a new **Notebook** with `## Requirements` and `## Architecture` sections.
3. **Execution**: As you code, use `write_notebook` to keep the logic and implementation details updated in real-time.
4. **Bug Tracking**: Discover a bug? Record it immediately with `jot #bug` for later resolution.

### 2. Technical Documentation Management
Traditional technical docs often "die" in static Markdown files. With Semoia, your AI actively maintains them.
- **Dependency Management**: When you add a new library, the AI can automatically update the `## Dependencies` section in your documentation notebook.
- **Logic Explainer**: Ask: *"Summarize the current state of our auth flow in the 'Architecture' notebook."*

### 3. Multi-AI Consultation (Cross-Agent Debugging)
Found a bug that Cursor can't solve?
- **Step 1 (Cursor)**: Ask Cursor to "Save context" of the current issue.
- **Step 2 (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)**: Open Claude Desktop, load that Context ID, and ask: *"Considering this background, why is this logic failing at line 45?"*
- **Step 3 (Cursor)**: Bring the solution back to Cursor and execute the fix.

## Industry Scenarios

| Scenario | Workflow |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Onboarding** | Point new developers to the "Onboarding" Notebook for an instant context dump. |
| **Research** | Use Jots to collect paper summaries and Notebooks to synthesize them into a literature review. |
| **Incident Response** | Record the timeline of an incident with Jots and summarize the post-mortem in a Notebook. |
