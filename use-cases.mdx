## 💡 Common Workflows

### 1. "Second Brain" for Developers
Instead of trying to remember every complex logic, ask your AI to save it to a Notebook. Next time you need it, simply ask: *"Explain the payment processing logic I noted last week"* and Semoia will provide the exact context.

### 2. Work Log & Task Tracking
Use **Jots** to record tasks or bugs as you discover them while coding:
> *"Save jot: Reconfigure OAuth 2.1 #priority #task"*

### 3. Documentation & Research
When learning a new library or tool, ask your AI: *"Summarize the key takeaways for library X into my 'Research' notebook."* You can now access this knowledge in any future project.

### 4. Context Transfer Between AI Agents
Moving from Cursor to Claude Desktop for a deeper analysis? 
1. **In Cursor**: *"Save this conversation context"* → Get a Context ID.
2. **In Claude**: *"Load context [ID]"*.
The AI will now have the full background of your previous discussion.

### 5. Project Knowledge Management
Create dedicated Notebooks for each project to store:
- Database Schema definitions.
- Specific Business Logic.
- Key Design Decisions.
