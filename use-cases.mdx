## Common Workflows

### 1. Developer Documentation
Capture logic explanations and architecture decisions as you build. Semoia turns these into a searchable knowledge base for your entire codebase.

### 2. Research & Learning
Use Semoia to save deep-dives into complex topics. When you start a new related project, your AI will already have the background knowledge.

### 3. Content Creation
Organize your ideas, outlines, and drafts across different AI sessions. Maintain consistency in tone and style by providing the AI with your previous work as context.

### 4. Project Management
Keep track of meeting summaries, decision logs, and action items discussed with your AI project assistant.
