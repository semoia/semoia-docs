Notebooks are places where your AI saves important project details. Unlike a simple text file, a Notebook helps the AI "learn" and "remember" as your project grows.

## Smart Saving

When your AI saves to a Notebook, it:
1. **Organizes Automatically**: It uses headings to keep things in the right place.
2. **Only Changes What's New**: It updates specific parts and keeps the rest safe.
3. **Saves History**: It remembers old versions so you can go back if you need to.

## Notebook Tools

Your AI can use these simple tools:

- **`list_notebooks`**: See all your notebooks.
- **`create_notebook`**: Make a new notebook for a project.
- **`read_notebook`**: Read the latest notes in a notebook.
- **`write_notebook`**: Save new information or change existing notes.
- **`search_notebooks`**: Find specific details just by asking a question.
- **`rollback_notebook`**: Undo the last change if the AI made a mistake.
- **`delete_notebook`**: Remove a notebook forever.

## Tips

- Give your notebooks clear names like "My App Idea" or "Recipe Box".
- Use hashtags like `#important` to help the AI find things faster.
- Ask your AI: *"What is in my 'Study Notes' notebook?"*
