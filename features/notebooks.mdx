Notebooks are for important, long-term information. They help your AI stay "grounded" in your project details.

## Real-World Examples

### 1. Starting a New Project
When you start a new app, you can use the **`create_notebook`** tool to make a notebook called "Project Requirements". 
- Use **`list_notebooks`** to see all your current projects.
- The AI will automatically save your folder structure and design rules.
Next time you chat, the AI will use **`read_notebook`** to remember how to build things correctly.

### 2. Managing Technical Docs
Instead of searching through old files, use **`write_notebook`** to keep your tech docs updated. 
- **Example**: If you add a new library, the AI will update the setup steps in your notebook. 
- **Benefit**: Ask the AI: *"How do I add a new page?"* and it will use **`search_notebooks`** to give you the perfect answer.

## How it Works Simply
- **Auto-Organize**: The AI keeps your notes tidy using headings.
- **Smart Updates**: Using **`write_notebook`**, only the changes you want are saved.
- **History**: Use **`rollback_notebook`** to go back to old versions if the AI makes a mistake.
