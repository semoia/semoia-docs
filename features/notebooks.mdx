Notebooks are for important, long-term information. They help your AI stay "grounded" in your project details.

## Tools

Your AI can use these commands to manage notebooks:

- **`list_notebooks`**: See all your notebooks.
- **`create_notebook`**: Make a new notebook for a project.
- **`read_notebook`**: Read the latest notes.
- **`write_notebook`**: Save new information or change notes.
- **`search_notebooks`**: Find specific details just by asking.
- **`rollback_notebook`**: Undo the last change if the AI made a mistake.
- **`delete_notebook`**: Remove a notebook forever.

## Use Cases

### 1. Starting a New Project
Use **`create_notebook`** to make a notebook called "Project Requirements". 
- Save your folder structure and main rules.
- Later, the AI uses **`read_notebook`** so it doesn't have to ask you how to build things again.

### 2. Managing Tech Docs
Use **`write_notebook`** to keep your technical documentation updated. 
- When you add a new feature, the AI updates the relevant sections automatically.
- Use **`search_notebooks`** to find setup steps or logic rules instantly.
