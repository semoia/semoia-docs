Notebooks are structured "smart ledgers" designed to preserve critical information across multiple sessions. Think of a Notebook as a persistent manual that your AI can reference, learn from, and update intelligently.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy: Smart Merge

Unlike traditional text files, Semoia Notebooks are built for **evolution**. 

When your AI "writes" to a notebook, it doesn't just append text; it performs a **Smart Merge**:
1. **Structural Awareness**: The system parses Markdown headings (`#`, `##`) into nodes.
2. **Delta Updates**: If the AI updates your `## API List`, other sections like `## Setup Guide` remain untouched, saving context window and preventing data loss.
3. **Checkpoints**: Every update creates a new version, allowing you to track the growth of your project's knowledge over time.

## 🛠️ Notebook Tools

- **`list_notebooks`**: Overview of all your knowledge repositories. Each has a unique ID for precise AI access.
- **`create_notebook`**: Initialize a new space for a specific project (e.g., "Frontend Web", "Database Design").
- **`read_notebook`**: The AI retrieves the latest checkpoint to ground itself in your project's current state.
- **`write_notebook`**: The primary tool for structured recording. The AI "thinks" about the hierarchy as it saves.
- **`search_notebooks`**: Leverages **Hybrid Search** (combining keywords and semantic meaning) to find specific logic or code snippets from a simple natural language query.
- **`rollback_notebook`**: Built-in **Version Control**. Similar to `git revert`, this allows you to undo unwanted AI changes instantly.

## 💡 Best Practices

- **Use Hierarchy**: Use `#` tags to help the Smart Merge engine organize your knowledge effectively.
- **Modularize**: Create separate notebooks for different domains (e.g., separate your Business Logic from your Infrastructure).
- **Periodic Rollbacks**: Don't be afraid to experiment; you can always revert to a previous knowledge state.
