Notebooks are the core of Semoia's structured knowledge management. They are designed for long-form, organized content with full Markdown support.

## Core Features

- **Structured Content**: Organize your knowledge into sections and subsections.
- **Markdown Support**: Use the full power of Markdown to format your notes.
- **Intelligent Merging**: Semoia automatically merges new information into existing sections without clutter.

## Notebook Tools

When interacting with your AI agent, you can use the following tools:

- **`list_notebooks`**: View all your existing notebooks.
- **`create_notebook`**: Create a new notebook for a project or topic.
- **`read_notebook`**: View the latest version of a notebook's content.
- **`write_notebook`**: Save data to a notebook. Supports two modes:
    - **Merge (Default)**: Intelligently merges new content into relevant sections.
    - **Replace**: Overwrites the entire notebook.
- **`search_notebooks`**: Semantic search across all your notebooks to find exactly what you need.
- **`rollback_notebook`**: Undo the last write operation if something went wrong.
- **`delete_notebook`**: Permanently delete a notebook.

## Best Practices

1. **Specific Titles**: Give your notebooks clear, descriptive titles so the AI can find them easily.
2. **Use Sections**: Use `#` and `##` headings to help Semoia's merge engine organize your content.
3. **Semantic Search**: Don't worry about exact keywords; Semoia understands the context of your queries.
