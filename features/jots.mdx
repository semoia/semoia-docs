Creativity is unpredictable. Jots allow you to capture fleeting thoughts, tasks, and snippets without interrupting your main workflow.

## Core Philosophy: Fast & Free

Jots prioritize speed and ease of use. They are perfect for information that is temporary or hasn't yet earned a spot in a structured Notebook.

## Jot Tools

- **`jot`**: Capture anything instantly. The power lies in the freedom to record without formal structure.
- **`list_jots`**: A tag-based management system. Filter your thoughts effectively.
- **`search_jots`**: Uses **Vector Embeddings** for semantic search. Even if you only vaguely remember an idea, the AI can find it.
- **`delete_jot`**: Clean up temporary notes once they've been processed or moved to a Notebook.

## Intelligent Hashtag Strategies

Organize your "stream of consciousness" using hashtags:

- **Workflow Status**: Use `#todo` for tasks, `#done` for completed items, and `#bug` for technical issues.
- **Prioritization**: Tag items with `#urgent`, `#priority`, or `#backlog`.
- **Project Specifics**: Use `#projectA`, `#research`, or `#idea` to segment your thoughts.

## Best Practices

1. **Tag Early**: Developing a habit of adding hashtags makes retrieval significantly more powerful.
2. **Ask the AI**: You can ask your AI: *"What were my major `#idea` notes from last week?"* to perform a quick review.
3. **Promote to Notebook**: Once a collection of Jots matures into a project, ask your AI to synthesize them into a new **Notebook**.
