Jots are for information that comes to you quickly. Use them for things that are temporary or small.

## Real-World Examples

### 1. Recording a Fast Bug
While you are coding, you might see a small problem. Use the **`jot`** tool to capture it instantly.
- **Action**: Say *"jot #bug fix the login button color"*.
- **Benefit**: Later, use **`list_jots`** to see all your tasks and fix them all at once.

### 2. Meeting or Brainstorming Notes
If you have a new idea, don't let it get lost. 
- **Action**: Ask the AI to **`jot #idea use glassmorphism for the sidebar`**.
- **Benefit**: Later, use **`search_jots`** to find this idea even if you start a new chat.

## Tips for Jots
- **Use Tags**: Always use hashtags like `#todo`, `#research`, or `#priority` to find notes faster.
- **Ask to Find**: Ask your AI: *"What did I jot down about `#research` yesterday?"*
- **Move Up**: If a Jot becomes very important, ask the AI to move it into a **Notebook**.
