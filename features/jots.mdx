Jots are for quick thoughts and fast notes. They are perfect for things you want to remember right now but don't need a whole notebook for.

## Fast and Easy

Jots are built for speed. You can save a thought in second without worrying about structure.

## Jot Tools

Your AI uses these tools for jots:

- **`jot`**: Save a quick thought instantly.
- **`list_jots`**: See all your quick notes.
- **`search_jots`**: Find a note even if you can't remember the exact words.
- **`delete_jot`**: Remove a jot when you are done with it.

## Simple Tagging

You can use hashtags to organize your jots:
- Use `#todo` for things you need to do.
- Use `#idea` for new thoughts.
- Use `#bug` for problems you find.

Ask your AI: *"Show me all my `#idea` jots from today."*
