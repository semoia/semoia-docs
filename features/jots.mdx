Jots are designed for rapid knowledge capture. They are perfect for ideas, temporary tasks, or quick snippets of information that don't need a full notebook.

## Core Features

- **Rapid Capture**: Save thoughts in seconds using natural language.
- **Tagging**: Organize your jots using hashtags for easy filtering.
- **Semantic Retrieval**: Find jots based on their meaning, not just exact words.

## Jot Tools

Interact with Jots through these AI tools:

- **`jot`**: Save a quick thought. You can include hashtags directly in the text (e.g., *"Update the documentation #todo #projectX"*).
- **`list_jots`**: View your jots. You can filter by specific tags to focus on what matters.
- **`search_jots`**: Search through your quick notes using semantic search.
- **`delete_jot`**: Permanently remove a jot when it's no longer needed.
