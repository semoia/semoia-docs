Jots are for information that comes to you quickly. Use them for things that are temporary or small.

## Real-World Examples

### 1. Recording a Fast Bug
While you are coding, you might see a small problem but don't want to fix it yet.
- **Action**: Say `jot #bug fix the login button color`.
- **Benefit**: Later, you can ask: *"Show me all my `#bug` jots"* and fix them all at once.

### 2. Meeting or Brainstorming Notes
If you are talking to your AI about a new idea, don't let it get lost in the chat history.
- **Action**: Tell the AI to `jot #idea use glassmorphism for the sidebar`.
- **Benefit**: This idea is now saved forever, even if you start a new chat.

## Tips for Jots
- **Use Tags**: Always use hashtags like `#todo`, `#research`, or `#priority` to find notes faster.
- **Ask to Find**: Ask your AI: *"What did I jot down about `#research` yesterday?"*
- **Move Up**: If a Jot becomes very important, ask the AI to move it into a **Notebook**.
