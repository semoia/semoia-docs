Jots are for information that comes to you quickly. Use them for things that are temporary or small.

## Tools

Your AI uses these commands for jots:

- **`jot`**: Save a quick thought instantly.
- **`list_jots`**: See all your quick notes.
- **`search_jots`**: Find a note even if you can't remember the exact words.
- **`delete_jot`**: Remove a jot when you are done.

## How it Works

Jots are built for speed and ease of use.

1. **Fast Capture**: Just tell the AI to "**`jot`** this down". No structure is needed.
2. **Hashtag System**: Use hashtags (like `#todo`) to group jots. The AI can filter them using **`list_jots`**.
3. **Smart Search**: Even if your notes are messy, **`search_jots`** uses semantic search to find the right idea.

## Use Cases

### 1. Recording a Fast Bug
If you see a problem while coding, say: *"**`jot`** #bug fix the login button color"*. Later, use **`list_jots`** to find and fix all bugs at once.

### 2. Meeting or Brainstorming Notes
Save new ideas instantly: *"**`jot`** #idea use glassmorphism for the sidebar"*. These ideas are saved even if you start a new chat.
