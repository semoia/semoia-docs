Semoia gives your AI a long-term memory. It uses three main features to help you work better with AI.

## 1. Notebooks
**For long-term, structured project knowledge.**
Use Notebooks when you have a lot of information to save, like code rules, project requirements, or study notes. Notebooks keep your project's "big picture" safe.

## 2. Jots
**For fast notes and quick thoughts.**
Use Jots when you need to save something right now. It is perfect for "to-do" lists, quick ideas, or small bugs you find while coding.

## 3. Context Sharing
**For moving memory between different AI apps.**
Use Context Sharing to move your conversation from one AI (like Cursor) to another (like Claude). It ensures the new AI knows exactly what you were doing.
