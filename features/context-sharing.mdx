Context Sharing allows you to bridge the gap between different AI tools. You can save the state of a conversation in one agent and load it in another, ensuring a continuous workflow.

## Core Features

- **Agent Portability**: Move from Cursor to Claude Desktop or vice versa without losing progress.
- **Full History Preservation**: Captures the nuances and background of your current session.
- **On-Demand Loading**: Only load the context when you need it.

## Context Tools

- **`manage_context`**: The primary tool for saving and loading conversation states.
    - **Save**: Generates a unique Context ID for your current session.
    - **Load**: Uses a Context ID to retrieve and apply a previous session's background to the current agent.

## Example Workflow

1. **Step 1 (Cursor)**: You are deep in a debugging session. You ask: *"Save this conversation context."* The AI responds with a Context ID.
2. **Step 2 (Claude Desktop)**: You open a new window for a higher-level architectural review. You say: *"Load context [Context ID]"*.
3. **Step 3 (Success)**: Claude now understands everything you've already discussed and debugged in Cursor.
