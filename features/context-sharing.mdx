Context Sharing is a revolutionary feature that provides continuity across different "AI Hubs". It ensures that your AI agents share a single, evolving understanding of your work.

## Core Philosophy: Universal Memory

In the real world, no single AI is perfect for every task. You might use **Cursor** for rapid coding, **Claude Desktop** for complex logic, and **Windsurf** for autonomous flows. 

Semoia MCP acts as the **Universal Memory** that threads these agents together.

## Context Tools

- **`manage_context(action: 'save')`**: The AI analyzes the current conversation, extracts key points, modified files, and crucial decisions, compressing them into a "Concise Memory".
- **`manage_context(action: 'load')`**: Decompresses that memory into a new AI agent, grounding it instantly.

## The Multi-AI Workflow

The true power of Context Sharing shines in cross-agent collaboration:

1. **Capture (Cursor)**: You finish a complex debugging session and save the context.
2. **Consult (Claude)**: You load that context into Claude 3.5 Sonnet to ask: *"Given this context, how should we refactor the modular architecture for scalability?"*
3. **Execute (Windsurf)**: You save the refined architecture from Claude and load it into Windsurf to automate the refactoring process.

## Best Practices

- **Explicit Saving**: Manually ask your AI to "Save context" before switching tasks or agents to ensure the latest insights are captured.
- **Context IDs**: Keep track of your Context IDs to create "checkpoints" for different branches of a conversation.
