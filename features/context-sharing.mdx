Context Sharing lets your AI memory follow you when you switch apps.

## Real-World Examples

### 1. Moving from Coding to Solving
You are coding in **Cursor** and find a very hard bug. You want to ask a smarter model like **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** for help.
- **Action**: Tell Cursor to "Save context". It gives you an ID like `BUG-FIX-123`.
- **Action**: Open Claude and say "Load context `BUG-FIX-123`".
- **Benefit**: Claude now knows exactly what you were doing in Cursor and can help you solve the bug instantly.

### 2. Saving a Long Conversation
If you have been talking to an AI for a long time, the chat can get very slow or messy.
- **Action**: Tell the AI to "Save context". 
- **Action**: Start a fresh chat and "Load context".
- **Benefit**: The AI starts a brand new, fast chat but still remembers all the important decisions you made.

## Why it Matters
No AI is perfect for every task. Semoia lets you use the best AI for the job while keeping your project memory in one place.
