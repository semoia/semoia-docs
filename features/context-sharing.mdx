Context Sharing lets your AI memory follow you when you switch apps.

## Real-World Examples

### 1. Moving from Coding to Solving
You are coding in **Cursor** and find a hard bug. You want to ask a smarter model like **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** for help.
- **Action**: Tell Cursor to use **`manage_context`** with the 'save' action. It gives you a Context ID.
- **Action**: Open Claude and use **`manage_context`** with the 'load' action and that ID.
- **Benefit**: Claude now knows exactly what you were doing in Cursor and can help you instantly.

### 2. Saving a Long Conversation
If your chat gets too long and slow, use **`manage_context`** to refresh it.
- **Action**: "Save" your context in the current chat. 
- **Action**: Start a new chat and "Load" that context.
- **Benefit**: The AI starts a brand new, fast chat but still remembers all your important project decisions.

## Why it Matters
No AI is perfect for every task. Semoia lets you use the best AI for the job while keeping your project memory in one place.
