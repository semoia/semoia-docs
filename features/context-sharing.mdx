Context Sharing lets your AI memory follow you when you switch apps.

## Unified Context Tool

The **`manage_context`** tool is the key to moving memory. It has two main actions:

- **`save`**: The AI compresses the core details of your chat into a "Context ID".
- **`load`**: A new AI uses the "Context ID" to instantly remember everything.

## How It Works

This feature creates a "thread of continuity" between different AI tools.

1. **Capture**: You finish work in **Cursor** and ask to "Save context". 
2. **ID Generation**: Semoia gives you a special ID (like `DEV-LOG-123`).
3. **Handover**: Open a model like **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** and say *"Load context `DEV-LOG-123`"*.
4. **Resolution**: Claude now has the full background and can help you solve complex problems without you re-explaining everything.

This ensures you always use the best AI for the job while keeping one project memory.
