Context Sharing lets you move your AI's "brain" from one tool to another. You can save what you are talking about in one app and load it in a different app.

## Why Use It?

Sometimes you want to switch tools. For example:
- Use **Cursor** to write code.
- Use **Claude** to solve a hard problem.
- Use **Windsurf** for fast automation.

Semoia lets your AI remember everything as you switch between these tools.

## Tools

- **`manage_context(action: 'save')`**: Save the current conversation. You will get a special "Context ID".
- **`manage_context(action: 'load')`**: Open a new AI tool and say *"Load context [ID]"*. The AI will instantly remember what you were doing.

## Simple Example

1. In **Cursor**, you ask the AI to "Save context". 
2. The AI gives you an ID (like `ABC-123`).
3. In **Claude**, you say "Load context `ABC-123`".
4. Claude now knows everything you and Cursor were just talking about!
